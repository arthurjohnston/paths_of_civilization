Notes

Scoring was 3 points per tech production of cards in hand, 1/2 point per cube or tech,  first place was a 2 way tie at 72 pts but there were around 20 with scores of 70+. Interestingly most of the top scores have all 5 tech, but then ones that don't pick up an extra green or brown and drop a level 1 yellow around turn 5
At end of Turn 7
