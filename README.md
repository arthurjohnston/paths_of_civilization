This is a script to run a simulation of "Paths of Civilization" to understand what the optimal play order.

General usage is 
```
python3 paths_of_civ.py  7 1000
```

Where the first argument is the number of turns you want to simulate and the second argument is the number of scenarios you want to print. Default is 3 and 30. If you want to save the output instead of standard output


```

python3 paths_of_civ.py  7 1000 > top_1000_turn_7.txt
```
